Returns true if...
-e: file exits
-a: file exists (identical to -e, but has been deprecated)
-f: file is a regular file (not a directory or device file)
-s: file is not zero size
-d: file is a directory
-b: file is a block device
-c: file is a character device
-p: file is a pipe
-h: file is a symbolic link
-L: file is a symbolic link
-S: file is a socket
-t: file is associated with a terminal device (this option may be used to check whether the stdin [ -t 0 ] or stdout [ -t 1 ] in a given script is a terminal.)
-r: file has read permission (for the user running the test)
-w: file has write permission (for the user running the test)
-x: file has execute permission (for the user running the test)
-g: set-group-id (sgid) flag set on file or directory 
(if a directory has the sgid flag set, then a file created within that directory belongs to the group that owns the directory, not necessarily to the group of the user who created the file. Useful for directory shared by workgroups.)
-u: set-user-id (suid) lag set on file 
(binary owned by root with suid flag set runs with root privileges only. Useful for executables like pppd and edrecord that need to access system hardware.)
-k: sticky bit set
(flag that is a special type of file permission. If a file has this flag set, that file will be kept in cache memory for quicker access. If set on a directory, it restricts write permission. Adds a t to the permissions on the file or directory listing. This restricts altering or deleting specific files in that directory to the owner of those files. If a user does not own a directory that has -k, but has write permission in that directory, she can only delete those files that she owns in it.)
-O: you are owner of file
-G: group-id of file same as yours
_N: file modified since it was last read
f1 -nt f2: file f1 is newer than f2
f1 -ot f2: file f2 is older than f2
f1 -ef f2: files f1 and f2 are hard links to the same file
!: "not" -- reverses the senses of the tests above (returns true if condition is absent)
