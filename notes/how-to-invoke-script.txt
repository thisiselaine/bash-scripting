You can invoke the script by 'sh scriptname' or 'bash scriptname.'

Or, make the script itself directly executable with a chmod. 

Your options:
chmod 555 scriptname (gives everyone read/execute permission)
chmod +rx scriptname (same as above)
chmod u+rx scriptname (gives only the owner read/execute permission)

Test by running './scriptname'. 

You would likely want to move the script to /usr/local/bin (as root)
to make the script available to all other users as a systemwide exe.

The script can then be invoked by simply typing scriptname [ENTER]
from the command line.
